# Block Finance - A Next.js and Django Dashboard Application
    This is a Work trial task. A sample application of how to represent several datasets visually using charts.
    


## Setup and Run

### Backend (Django)
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `rav run migrate`
3. `rav run server`

### Frontend (Next.js)
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

### Docker (Optional)
1. `docker-compose build`
2. `docker-compose up`

## Approach
- Implemented the frontend with Next.js and React.
- Used Django Ninjah Framework for API endpoints.
- Integrated Chart.js for rendering charts.
- Integrated Redux for receiving and storing data globally (This avoids the need to make a request on every page.)

## Libraries
- Next.js
- Django Ninjah
- Chart.js
- React-Chartjs-2
- Redux
